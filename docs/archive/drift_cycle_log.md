# DRIFT — Cycle Log
*Specs are appended at OPEN (C1); as-builts and audit verdicts at SHIP/CLOSE (C2/C3). Canonical home: repo `/docs/` from Cycle 01 onward. The TUNE ledger mirrors `tune.ts`.*

## TUNE ledger (current values)

| Constant | Value | Since | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dayLengthRealMinutes` | 60 | C01 | One clock, online and offline; 1 game hour = 2.5 real minutes |
| `warmthMax` | 100 | C01 | |
| `warmthDrainPerGameHourNight` | 12 | C01 | Night only this cycle; without fire you bottom out ~8 game hours into a 12-hour night — fire is priority #1 |
| `warmthRegenPerGameHourAtFire` | 30 | C01 | Inside fire light radius |
| `gatherSecondsPerWood` | 3 | C01 | Real seconds, tap-hold |
| `woodPerFire` | 5 | C01 | Build cost of a campfire |
| `fireBurnGameHoursPerWood` | 2 | C01 | 5-wood fire ≈ 10 game hours ≈ most of one night; adding a 6th covers it |
| `morningReportMinRealMinutes` | 2 | C01 | Absence below this produces no report |

## CYCLE 01 — "First Fire"
**Phase 1 · Tier: Opus-class · Status: OPEN · Opened 2026-07-22**

**HANDOFF BLOCK** — director: paste into Claude Code opened in the project folder:

```
Tier: Opus-class. You are C2 — Builder for DRIFT.
This folder is the project root and contains the six project documents.
Boot: read drift_project_charter_v0_1.md (Parts I–II), drift_ops_protocol_v1_0.md (all of it),
and Cycle 01 in drift_cycle_log.md. Doc deltas: none — these files are current canon;
move all six to /docs/ in Stage 0.
Confirm boot in ≤5 lines (goal + acceptance checks), then execute Cycle 01 end-to-end with
standing authority, Stage 0 through Stage 3. No approval stops. Once deployed, spawn the
C3 audit (Ops §4); on PASS, append the as-built note to /docs/drift_cycle_log.md per Ops §7
and report the play URL in one line.
```

**GOAL:** Prove DRIFT's spine on a phone — crash → move → gather → fire → warmth → quit → reopen → an honest morning report — on the permanent brain/body architecture.

**SCOPE IN (build in stage order):**

- **Stage 0 — Foundation.** Git repo (C2 creates it on GitHub via `gh`, public); Vite + Phaser 3 + TypeScript scaffold; layout per Ops §5; Vitest; CI running tests plus the brain-purity check (build fails on any Phaser import under `/src/brain/`); GitHub Pages auto-deploy on push to main; `/docs/` populated with the six documents.
- **Stage 1 — Brain.** World clock (real-time anchored, `dayLengthRealMinutes`); warmth vital (night drain, fire-radius regen, clamped 0–max); fire entity (fuel units, burn rate, lit/out); wood node + minimal inventory; versioned save (`schemaVersion: 1`, localStorage, saved on `visibilitychange`/`pagehide`); `reconcile(elapsedRealSeconds)` — a pure function advancing clock, fire, and warmth for any absence length; morning-report composer (plain prose from reconcile results, produced only when absence ≥ `morningReportMinRealMinutes`). Full test coverage: clock math, reconcile over short/medium/long absences, fire exhaustion timing, warmth clamps, save round-trip.
- **Stage 2 — Body.** One handcrafted beach + treeline scene (placeholder tiles); tap-to-move; tap-hold driftwood/deadfall to gather wood (`gatherSecondsPerWood`) with a visible inventory count; build a campfire from `woodPerFire` at the player's spot; add wood to extend the burn; day/night tint + fire light radius; warmth bar; the crash cold-open as a two-line text card (you wash ashore at dusk — cold is coming); morning-report overlay on qualifying reopen.
- **Stage 3 — Audit & ship.** Deploy; archive to `/builds/c01/`; tag `c01`; spawn the C3 audit; on PASS, append the as-built note and report the play URL.

**SCOPE OUT (explicit):** thirst / hunger / energy / oxygen; health and death; building tiers, upkeep, decay; skills, XP, the Development Tree; any resource but wood; any production loop; threats; procedural islands; audio; real art. (All arrive in Cycles 02+ per the roadmap.)

**ACCEPTANCE CHECKS:**
- **A1** — Brain suite green, including: reconcile over 1 minute / 8 real hours / 3 real days; fire exhausts at exactly `fuel × fireBurnGameHoursPerWood`; warmth clamps at bounds; save survives a schema round-trip.
- **A2** — Purity check green: zero Phaser imports under `/src/brain/`, CI-enforced.
- **A3** — On a phone browser via the public URL: first load ≤ ~5 s on 4G, playable one-thumb, no pinch/zoom traps, survives tab-switching without losing state.
- **A4** — The steel thread on-device: gather ≥5 wood → light fire → warmth visibly recovers → background/close the app ≥2 real minutes → reopen → morning report matches `tune.ts` math for the elapsed time.
- **A5** — Stable URL live; `/builds/c01/` archived; `c01` tag pushed; as-built note appended.
